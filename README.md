# Mixed neural likelihood estimation for models of decision-making

This repository contains code for reproducing the results of the paper "Flexible and efficient simulation-based inference for models of decision-making".

It also contains the main research code for MNLE, which will be integrated into the [`sbi`](https://github.com/mackelab/sbi) toolbox soon.

## Content

The `notebooks` folder contains jupyter notebooks for reproducing the figures presented in the paper.

The core code for MNLE is in `notebooks/mnle_utils.py`.
