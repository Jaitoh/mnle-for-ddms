# Mixed neural likelihood estimation for models of decision-making

This repository contain code for reproducing the results of the paper "Flexible and efficient simulation-based inference for models of decision-making".

It also contains the main research code for MNLE, which will be integrated into the (`sbi`)[https://github.com/mackelab/sbi] toolbox soon.

## Installation

For installation run 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

If you encounter problems, please create an issue.

## Content

The `notebooks` folder contains jupyter notebooks for reproducing the figures presented in the paper.

In `notebooks/MNLE_example.ipynb` you find a demonstration of how to use MNLE on a simulation-based model like the DDM.

The core code for MNLE is in `notebooks/mnle_utils.py`.

Please do not hesitate to create an issue if you have questions or encounter problems.
